# Reflections on FOSS

 The Catheral and and the Bazzar starts off very  well I think. In the beginning it gives a detailed summary of the development of the Linux operating software. The concept of open source development has two methods: the Cathedral method, where a large coporation hires alot of programmers to develop software, they want to  keeps the source code secret, and charges large amounts to recoup it costs, not from the original product development, but from the expected legacy problems, technical support, bug fixing, software updates, etc. And then we have the bazaar method, which is the main focus of our class which  encourages open source software. Open source software encourages a programmer or team such as ourself  within the  community to gain the nesscary power to  maintain and lift  the software to keep it relevant. Per the authtor if things continue the way they are the Cathedral method will not be able to compete with the Bazaar method. In the Cathedral method the programmers must be hired and bought, the bazaar method the hackers are like magnets they are attracted to a problem, become more dedicated in fixing the problem for knowldge and practice , revisions and bugs are handled at internet speed. The author contnue to talka  out how many company business model has adopted the open source devleopment method(bazaar). As you read further into the book the auther  explains the hacker ethic and communtiy and how everything works. It was cool to understand the meaning of"hacker" v.s. "cracker" and the true meaning of free software. The author say in the future  that open source software will make deep in-roads into the Fortune-500 companies. That their investmeent in thier hardware and investment being dependent on one software company to make changes is stupid.  Open source software would provide a proliferation of hacker communities willing to constantly update older software. The author appears to know his stuff and progressively throughout the book the author lets it leak out that he is one of the hacker community and is a player/spokesman in this software battle I found this book a real eye-opener, can Microsoft's workforce continue to support software like Windows 2000 with 60 million lines of code, as opposed to Linux taking advantage of a worldwide army of hackers reporting bugs, writing patches, and keeping hardware drivers updated. Time will tell. Then after reading the book me and my team got together and tried to figure out our own open source to work on. We met up on zoom and was kind of overwhelemed just by the many possablities out there that we could choose from. Like how do we narrow it down to three choice and how do we chose one to work on. So we asked ourselves three question : how active is the open source, is there devlopment zone and contribution very detailed and documented on how to make contrubtion and how many issue they post and our these possible issue we can fix. By doing that we limited choose to some we like for example : zulip and mifos . These project had excellent documentation on how to contribute and what ways one person can contribute and it was in programs we liked.
